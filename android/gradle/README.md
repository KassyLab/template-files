# Gradle Template Configuration files

## How to use

### Configure Gradle Library Project

- Configure your Project's `build.gradle` like this :

		buildscript {
		    repositories {
			jcenter()
		    }
		    dependencies {
			classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.1'
			classpath 'com.github.dcendents:android-maven-gradle-plugin:2.0'
		    }
		}
		plugins {
		    id "com.jfrog.bintray" version "1.7.3"
		}
		allprojects {
		    repositories {
			jcenter()
		    }
		}

- In the library module's `build.gradle`, add following:

		apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

		ext {
		    bintrayRepo = 'REPOSITORY_NAME'
		    bintrayName = 'PACKAGE_NAME'

		    publishedGroupId = 'GROUP_ID'
		    libraryName = 'LIBRARY_NAME'
		    artifact = 'LIBRARY_NAME'

		    libraryDescription = 'LIBRARY_DESCRIPTION'

		    siteUrl = 'SITE_URL'
		    gitUrl = 'GIT_URL'

		    libraryVersion = 'LIBRARY_VERSION'

		    developerId = 'DEVELOPER_ID'
		    developerName = 'DEVELOPER_NAME'
		    developerEmail = 'DEVELOPER_EMAIL'
		    
		    organization = 'ORGANIZATION' // if you push to organization's repository.

		    licenseName = 'The Apache Software License, Version 2.0'
		    licenseUrl = 'http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt'
		    allLicenses = ["Apache-2.0"]
		}

- Finally, at the end of the library module's `build.gradle`, add:

		//These two remote files contain Bintray configuration as described above.
		apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KassyLab/template-files/master/android/gradle/install.gradle'
		apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KassyLab/template-files/master/android/gradle/bintray.gradle'

### Configure Bintray credentials

There are two methods to configure Bintray credentials :

- Add the two environment variables following :

		export BINTRAY_USER="Your Bintray user ID"
		export BINTRAY_KEY="Your Bintray API Key"

- Run Bintray upload command with following arguments :

		./gradlew build bintrayUpload -PbintrayUser=<Your Bintray user ID> -PbintrayApiKey=<Your Bintray API Key>

### Uploading to Bintray

CD to Root of Android Studio Project, and run these commands:

	./gradlew install
	./gradlew build bintrayUpload
